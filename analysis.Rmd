This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

setwd("/home/abb/Documents/www2/hyperaudioRecorder/")

for (id in c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)){
  tab <- read.table(paste0("text-analysis-ke",id,".csv"), header=TRUE, sep=",")
  plot <- ggplot(tab, aes(x=flesh, y = words)) + 
    geom_point(na.rm=TRUE) +
    labs(title=paste0("Kurseinheit ",id), x="Flesh Index", y='Words per sentence')
  print(plot)
}


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
